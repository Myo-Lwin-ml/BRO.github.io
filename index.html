      <h2>A memory I will never forget</h2>
      <p>They say love finds you when you least expect it. I didn’t know how true that was until the day I met you. We were two people, from two different continents — you from Africa, me from Myanmar — and somehow, fate brought us to the same island: <strong>Phuket, Thailand</strong>.</p>
      <p>I messaged you on a dating app, heart racing and fingers shaking. I asked, "Do you want to meet me?" And you said yes.</p>

      <h2>The First Time I Saw You</h2>
      <p>You walked toward me, under the warm Thai sun, wearing just a simple shirt and shorts. But to me, you looked like the most beautiful man I had ever seen.</p>
      <p>Your smile melted every fear I had. And in that moment, something inside me whispered: <em>“This is him. This is the one.”</em></p>

      <h2>Proposal</h2>
      <p>That first meeting didn’t feel like the beginning. It felt like a reunion — like I had found someone I had always been searching for. People used to say that don't fall in love with someone easily. You will be played . I would definitely say "NOOO". My life, my logic.
         Why do we need to wait for showing how much we love them. Life is too short to wait for the right time. If you love someone, just tell them. If you want to be with them, just be with them. Don't wait for the right time. Because there is no right time. Yayy, I did propose firstly in text cos I was too shy and afraid of being ignored or 
        rejected. But I did propose second time in person successfully. "Yayyy"</p>

      <h2>Forever Thankful</h2>
      <p>Phuket will always be more than a place to me — it’s the sacred ground where my heart finally met its home. And that home is you, <strong>Rowan Strydom</strong>.</p>
      <p>Thank you for wearing that shirt and shorts that day. Thank you for saying yes. Thank you for being beautiful — outside and in. <strong>You are my story. You are my everything.</strong></p>
