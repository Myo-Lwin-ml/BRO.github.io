      <h2>A memory I will never forget</h2>
      <p>They say love finds you when you least expect it. I didn’t know how true that was until the day I met you. We were two people, from two different continents — you from Africa, me from Myanmar — and somehow, fate brought us to the same island: <strong>Phuket, Thailand</strong>.</p>
      <p>I messaged you on a dating app, heart racing and fingers shaking. I asked, "Do you want to meet me?" And you said yes.</p>

      <h2>The First Time I Saw You</h2>
      <p>You walked toward me, under the warm Thai sun, wearing just a simple shirt and shorts. But to me, you looked like the most beautiful man I had ever seen.</p>
      <p>Your smile melted every fear I had. And in that moment, something inside me whispered: <em>“This is him. This is the one.”</em></p>

      <h2>Proposal</h2>
      <p>That first meeting didn’t feel like the beginning. It felt like a reunion — like I had found someone I had always been searching for. People used to say that don't fall in love with someone easily. You will be played . I would definitely say "NOOO". My life, my logic.
         Why do we need to wait for showing how much we love them. Life is too short to wait for the right time. If you love someone, just tell them. If you want to be with them, just be with them. Don't wait for the right time. Because there is no right time. Yayy, I did propose firstly in text cos I was too shy and afraid of being ignored or 
        rejected. But I did propose second time in person successfully. "Yayyy"</p>

      <h2>Forever Thankful</h2>
      <p>Phuket will always be more than a place to me — it’s the sacred ground where my heart finally met its home. And that home is you, <strong>Rowan Strydom</strong>.</p>
      <p>Thank you for wearing that shirt and shorts that day. Thank you for saying yes. Thank you for being beautiful — outside and in. <strong>You are my story. You are my everything.</strong></p>

      <h2>Why do you love me?</h2>
      <p> I hate that question so much. True love has no reason. <br>
        Cos for me, I love the way you smile. <br>
        I love the way you talk. <br> 
        I love the way you look at me. <br>
      I love the way you care.<br>
        I love the way you listen to me. <br>
        I love your imperfections.<br>
      I love your everything.</p>
            but I still don't think it will be enough answer cos actions do matter.<p>

I honestly hate that question — because true love doesn’t come with reasons.
But if you ask me why I love you, I can try to explain… <br>
I love the way you smile, how it lights up even my worst days.<br>
I love the way you talk — the softness, the laughter, the honesty.<br>
I love the way you look at me, like I matter, even when I feel lost.<br>
I love how deeply you care, how you notice the little things.<br>
I love that you listen, really listen — not just to my words, but to my silences.<br>
I love your flaws, your quirks, the imperfect things that make you real.<br>
I love every piece of you.<br>

But I also know words aren’t always enough.
So I’ll keep showing you — through my patience, my presence, my small gestures —
That my love is more than just a feeling.
It’s a promise I would like to try to keep every single day.
