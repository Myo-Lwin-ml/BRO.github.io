      <h2>A memory I will never forget</h2>
      <p>They say love finds you when you least expect it. I didn’t know how true that was until the day I met you. We were two people, from two different continents — you from Africa, me from Myanmar — and somehow, fate brought us to the same island: <strong>Phuket, Thailand</strong>.</p>
      <p>I messaged you on a dating app, heart racing and fingers shaking. I asked, "Do you want to meet me?" And you said yes.</p>

      <h2>The First Time I Saw You</h2>
      <p>You walked toward me, under the warm Thai sun, wearing just a simple shirt and shorts. But to me, you looked like the most beautiful man I had ever seen.</p>
      <p>Your smile melted every fear I had. And in that moment, something inside me whispered: <em>“This is him. This is the one.”</em></p>

      <h2>Lunch with him</h2>
            <p> That day you took me out for lunch… ohhh, I was so happy.You picked me up from my room and brought me to the restaurant. 
              I sat behind you, stealing glances—your ears, your back—unable to look away.
              Choosing from the menu was so hard for me; I don’t know many dishes like you do. 
              I just wanted to try whatever you had.And the way my heart wouldn’t stop racing… I couldn’t control it.
              You gave me a warmth I’d never felt before. Afterward, you even dropped me off at work. 
              These memories? They’ll never fade, even if I’m gone one day. 
              I try to hold back, but I can’t—I just want to reach out, to hug you, to be close to you.
              But at the same time, I’m scared… scared you might turn away.  </p>

      <h2>Proposal</h2>
     <p>When we first met, it didn’t feel like a beginning — it felt like coming home, like finding someone I’d been searching for without even knowing it. 
       People often say, “Don’t fall too fast; you might get hurt.” But I’ve always believed in following my heart, not the rules.
       Why should we wait to express love when life moves so quickly? Time doesn’t promise us perfect moments. If you love someone, tell them. 
       If you want to be with them, go. Love doesn’t need permission or the perfect setting — it just needs courage. 
       I was shy at first, so I proposed you through a message, scared of being ignored or rejected. But my heart didn’t give up.
       And yes, the second time, I gathered all my courage and told you in person —Yayyy..I did propose yoou. ❤️</p>

      <h2>Celerating my first achievement</h2>
<p>That was truly one of the happiest moments of my life. I still remember the thrill of taking you on a ride with my very first motorcycle. 
  It wasn’t just a ride — it felt like a dream coming true. You, sitting behind me, holding me gently, made everything feel perfect. 
  That moment wasn’t just about the motorcycle; it was about sharing a milestone with someone who means everything to me.
  You were my special person, and that bike was my first big achievement. The two of you together made it unforgettable. It felt like the universe gave me two precious gifts at once. I couldn’t stop smiling the entire time. Honestly, I’ll cherish that memory forever — my first man, my first ride, and a feeling I’ll never forget.</p>       <div class="hug-animation">

      <h2>Forever Thankful</h2>
      <p>Phuket will always be more than a place to me — it’s the sacred ground where my heart finally met its home. And that home is you, <strong>Rowan Strydom</strong>.</p>
      <p>Thank you for wearing that shirt and shorts that day. Thank you for saying yes. Thank you for being beautiful — outside and in. <strong>You are my story. You are my everything.</strong></p>

      <h2>Why do you love me?</h2>
     <p>

I honestly hate that question — because true love doesn’t come with reasons.
But if you ask me why I love you, I can try to explain… <br>
I love the way you smile, how it lights up even my worst days.<br>
I love the way you talk — the softness, the laughter, the honesty.<br>
I love the way you look at me, like I matter, even when I feel lost.<br>
I love how deeply you care, how you notice the little things.<br>
I love that you listen, really listen — not just to my words, but to my silences.<br>
I love your flaws, your quirks, the imperfect things that make you real.<br>
I love every piece of you.<br>

But I also know words aren’t always enough.
So I’ll keep showing you — through my patience, my presence, my small gestures —
That my love is more than just a feeling.
It’s a promise I would like to try to keep every single day.
